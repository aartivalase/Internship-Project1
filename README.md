This is a team Project of two members including me.

After meticulous data cleaning steps on the dataset, the optimal model emerged as
XGBoost, showcasing its effectiveness in predictive modeling. The achieved R2 score
of 92.27% indicates a high level of accuracy in capturing the variance within the data.
This success underscores the importance of rigorous data preprocessing in
enhancing model performance. The results affirm the suitability of XGBoost for the
specific characteristics of the cleaned dataset, highlighting its robustness in extracting
meaningful patterns.
